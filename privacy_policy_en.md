# iSnips Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 24, 2026

At iSnips, we values your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how iSnips ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles information when you use our browser extension.

## 1. Data Collection
iSnips is designed to be a "local-first" tool. 
- **User-Generated Content:** Captured text snippets, notes, and the source URLs of the pages where those snippets were captured.
- **Usage Data:** The extension does **not** collect any analytics, tracking data, or personal information about your browsing habits.

## 2. Data Storage
- **Local Storage:** All your captured snippets and settings are stored locally on your device using browser-based storage (IndexedDB and Chrome Storage). We do not have access to this data.
- **No Central Server:** We do not operate any central servers that store your content or personal information.

## 3. Data Synchronization (Optional)
iSnips offers optional synchronization features via Google Drive and WebDAV:
- **Google Drive:** If you enable Google Drive sync, the extension will store your data in its own private folder on **your** Google Drive. This data is only accessible by you and the extension.
- **WebDAV:** If you enable WebDAV sync, the extension will transmit your data to the server address you provided. We do not have access to these credentials or the stored data.

## 4. Third-Party Access
We do **not** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties. Your data is only shared with the specific sync providers (Google or your WebDAV host) that **you** explicitly configure.

## 5. Your Choices
- **Encryption:** You are responsible for the security of your device and your chosen sync accounts.
- **Data Deletion:** You can delete all your data at any time through the "Clear All Data" button in the extension settings.
- **Export:** You can export your data as a JSON file at any time.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
